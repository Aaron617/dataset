Another agreement was agreed upon in 2011 to exchange enclaves and adverse possessions . With respect to adverse possessions , India received 2,777.038 acres of land and transferred 2,267.682 acres to Bangladesh . India ratified the agreement by constitutional amendment in May 2015",

The 1855 Treaty of Shimoda acknowledged that both Russia and Japan had joint rights of occupation to Sakhalin , without setting a definite territorial demarcation . As the island became settled in the 1860s and 1870s , this ambiguity led to increasing friction between settlers . Attempts by the Tokugawa shogunate to purchase the entire island from the Russian Empire failed , and the new Meiji government was unable to negotiate a partition of the island into separate territories . In 1875 by the Treaty of Saint Petersburg , Japan agreed to give up its claims on Sakhalin in exchange for undisputed ownership of the Kuril Islands . In 1905 under the Treaty of Portsmouth Japan gained Sakhalin to the 60th parallel , but lost it again in 1945",
