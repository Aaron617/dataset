It took place on December 15 , 2001 . At the CZW Arena in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The event was at the first time in the CZW Arena . [ 3 ] Due to their upcoming annual COD show at the end of 2001 , the company needed a bigger venue and made their debut in the ECW Arena , formerly Viking Hall and currently The Arena . The venue was the first sellout in the building since the era of ECW , and hundreds were turned away from the biggest show in the promotions history . [ 4 ] Ty Street wrestled Mongoose to a no-contest . Jeff Rocker ran in and then Nate Hatred and Nick Gage came out and destroyed everyone . Nick Gage and Nate Hatred defeated a masked team suspiciously looking like Jay and Mark Briscoe ( who wrestled under masks presumably to get around the selectively enforced Pennsylvania age restrictions ) . NWA Southwest workers Joey Corman defeated Samir and Brad Michaels in a 3-Way Dance . Corman pinned Michaels after hitting the spin doctor .
