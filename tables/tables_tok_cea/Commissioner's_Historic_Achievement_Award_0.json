                "Sosa and Mark McGwire 's chase for the single-season home run record thrust the National League Central division into the spotlight , but Sosa 's Chicago Cubs finished ahead of McGwire 's St. Louis Cardinals in the division standings , second to the 102-win Houston Astros . Thus , Sosa was the recipient of the 1998 Most Valuable Player Award , though his 66 home runs placed him 4 behind McGwire 's record of 70 . Sosa went on to be the only player in MLB history to collect three 60-home-run seasons ( 1998 , 1999 , 2001 )",

    "intro": "The Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award is awarded by the Commissioner of Baseball, the chief executive of Major League Baseball (MLB), to a group or person who has made a major impact on the sport of baseball. It is not an annual award; rather, the Commissioner presents it at his discretion. The trophy is a gold baseball sitting atop a cylindrical silver base, created by Tiffany & Co. The award has been presented fourteen times by Commissioner Bud Selig: eleven times to players, once to a team, and twice to a non-player. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were the first to receive the award for their parts in the 1998 MLB home run record chase. The most recent recipient is Derek Jeter (2014), who was honored in the final year of his career for being one of the most accomplished shortstops of all-time. The 2001 Seattle Mariners won the award as a team for posting a 116-46 record one season after losing Alex Rodriguez to the Texas Rangers. Roberto Clemente, the 2006 awardee, is the only player to receive the award posthumously; his award was accepted by his wife, Vera. Three years after McGwire and Sosa were honored, Cal Ripken, Jr. and Tony Gwynn, both of whom retired after the 2001 season, received the award and were honored at the 2001 MLB All-Star Game; Ripken was elected to the American League All-Star team as a starter at third base, while Gwynn was later added as an honorary member of the National League team. During the first inning of the game, Rodriguez, who had been elected the starter at shortstop - the position at which Ripken played for most of his career - switched positions with Ripken for the first inning of the game as a tribute. Including the presentation of the award to the Mariners following the season, the 2001 season's three awards are the most presented in a single year. Barry Bonds received the award in 2002, becoming the third player so honored for breaking the single-season home run record."
