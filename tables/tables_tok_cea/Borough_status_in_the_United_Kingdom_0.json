    "section_text": "The privileges of borough status are that the council chairperson is called `` mayor '' and up to one quarter of councillors can be called `` alderman '' , and the council can award freedom of the borough . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The Municipal Corporations ( Ireland ) Act 1840 extinguished all the boroughs in Ireland except for ten . In what would in 1921 become Northern Ireland , there were two remaining municipal boroughs in 1840 : Belfast ( made a city in 1888 ) and Derry ( officially Londonderry , and a city since 1604 ) . Five towns with abolished corporations remained parliamentary boroughs until 1885 ( Armagh , Carrickfergus , Coleraine , Dungannon , and Enniskillen ) as did three ( Downpatrick , Lisburn , and Newry ) [ 38 ] where any corporation was defunct by 1801 . Several of the urban districts in Northern Ireland created under the Local Government ( Ireland ) Act 1898 later received charters granting borough status . The Local Government Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1972 replaced the multi-tier local government system with 26 unitary districts whose councils could retain the charter of a borough within the district ; other districts later received borough charters in their own right . The 2015 local government reforms replaced the 26 districts with 11 larger districts . The `` statutory transition committee '' handling each council merger had the right to request transfer of borough status as in 1972 , [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] and unionist-majority councils did so , while nationalist-majority councils chose not to apply . [ 42 ] There were complications where places had city status ; [ 43 ] [ 44 ] therefore Belfast , Derry and Lisburn 's borough charters carried over automatically , without the need for the council to pass a resolution . [ 45 ] Although Newry received city status in 2002 , Newry and Mourne District Council did not receive borough status . In 2015 its successor Newry , Mourne and Down District Council voted not to request borough status , the required two-thirds majority failing after opposition from Sinn F\u00e9in . [ 46 ]",

    "intro": "Borough status in the United Kingdom is granted by royal charter to local government districts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The status is purely honorary, and does not give any additional powers to the council or inhabitants of the district. In Scotland, similarly chartered communities were known as royal burghs, although the status is no longer granted."
