    "intro": "SciLands is an area within the virtual world Second Life devoted to science and technology. Member organizations share borders of their individual regions to create a larger virtual continent. By putting a wide range of educational content in close virtual proximity, the goal is to foster conversations and ideas that might not have occurred had each region been separate. Other goals include increasing visitor traffic and making it easier to find useful educational content within Second Life. SciLands members have regular meetings in Second Life where they share ideas, help each other, vote on new membership, and plan future projects. Members also share resources like meeting spaces, and developers. A current map of SciLands is located here. Initially, SciLands formed around the International Spaceflight Museum and NASA CoLab. However, since its establishment it has grown to host a variety of organizations including government agencies, universities, and museums."
