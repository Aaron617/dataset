                "Briggs was a lecturer in mathematics and in physic ( medicine ) at Cambridge , also becoming the first professor of geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1597 . He had become acquainted with the principles of Napier 's logarithm by 1615 : logarithms aided the calculations of astronomy and navigation that were carried out at Gresham since they allowed multiplication of multi-digit numbers to be carried out through the addition of their logarithms . The innovation that Briggs suggested to Napier was to use steps of 10 ( the common logarithm ) . After two visits by Briggs to John Napier in Edinburgh , they agreed a redefinition of the logarithm process , but Napier wrote in 1617 that the calculations would have to be carried out by others , including Briggs , because of his own ill health . Briggs is regarded as having created one of the most useful systems for mathematics . In 1624 , his main work , Arithmetica logarithmica , was published with calculations of the logarithms of 1 to 20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000 to fourteen decimal places . He died in Merton in 1631 and was buried in the choir of Merton College chapel",

                "Turner succeeded Briggs as professor of geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1620 ; he succeeded him in the Savilian professorship and resigned as Gresham professor in 1631 . Before this , he had been asked by William Laud ( Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of the University of Oxford ) to help draft new statutes to govern the university ; the final draft was his work , and was published in 1634 . During the English Civil War , he fought on the side of the Royalists and was captured near Stow-on-the-Wold in 1641 ; he was imprisoned in Southwark until an exchange of prisoners in 1643 . He was evicted from his fellowship at Merton and from the professorship by the Parliamentary visitors in charge of the university in 1648 , and died in poverty in 1652 . He appears to have published little of substance , despite a good contemporary reputation as a mathematician and classical scholar",

He later claimed to have been self-taught in mathematics thereafter , saying in his autobiography that he had studied it as a pleasing Diversion , at spare hours , adding that it then was regarded as more for Traders , Merchants , Seamen , Carpenters , Surveyors of Lands , or the like than as a subject for academical study at university level . He developed an interest in cryptography , working on behalf of the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War . He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society , writing over sixty papers and book reviews for it . After his appointment to the chair , he developed his mathematical skills such that he became one of the leading mathematicians of his time : he introduced \u221e { \\displaystyle \\infty } as the sign for infinity , influenced Isaac Newton with his writings , and took part in various mathematical debates with scholars such as Blaise Pascal and Thomas Hobbes . He was appointed Keeper of the Archives for the university in 1658 , and continued in his posts after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 until his death at the age of 86",

                "Halley , who later calculated the orbit of what became known as Halley 's comet , was already in correspondence with European astronomers as an undergraduate , writing three scientific papers in this time . He left Oxford to travel to St Helena for the 1677 transit of Mercury , so that he could calculate the distance of the sun ; his work brought him a leading reputation in Europe and election to the Royal Society aged 22 . He questioned Isaac Newton on the orbits of the planets , leading Newton to renew his study of the topic and write his Principia Mathematica in 1687 ; Halley supervised and paid for its publication . He failed to be appointed as Savilian Professor of Astronomy in 1691 , but was appointed by Newton to a position in the Royal Mint instead . His own works included discussion of rainbows , optics and barometers , and he calculated the site of Julius Caesar 's invasion of Britain by reference to the tides . He also carried out navigational surveys on behalf of the Royal Navy and drew up tables calculating the positions of the sun , moon and planets for many centuries . He was appointed Astronomer Royal in 1721",

From about 1805 , he substituted for Thomas Hornsby , Savilian Professor of Astronomy and reader in experimental philosophy , because of Hornsby 's illness . When Robertson succeeded Hornsby in 1810 , Rigaud was appointed to the geometry chair ; he succeeded his father at Kew in 1814 , becoming joint observer with his grandfather . He succeeded Robertson in the astronomy and experimental philosophy positions in 1827 . His wife died in the same year , and Rigaud devoted himself to his children and his work ; he has been described as the foremost historian of astronomy and mathematics in his generation , and as renowned for his personal and scholarly integrity",

He resigned his parish position when appointed to the chair , and was an active member of scientific organisations and commissions , with many publications to his credit . He was also noted for his stance on theological issues , opposing the work of the Oxford movement ( a group within the Church of England , sometimes referred to as Tractarians , who aimed to reform the church by reasserting its links with the early Catholic church ) , denying miracles and defending the theories of Charles Darwin . He advocated reform within the university , including improving the position of scientific studies , but opposition to his stance left him isolated at Oxford . He moved to London in 1854 , and mixed with leading individuals from science and literature . One of his sons was Robert Baden-Powell , the founder of the Scout Movement",

From 1874 , he was also Keeper of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History . He was heavily involved with university committees , advocating the place of science and mathematics at Oxford , and with royal commissions on scientific instruction and on universities .

                "Sylvester started at the University of London aged 14 but left after allegedly assaulting another student ; he later studied at Cambridge and was Second Wrangler ( second in the university mathematics examinations ) but could not be awarded a degree or prizes , or be made a college fellow , because he was Jewish . He then became professor of natural philosophy at University College , London for three years before moving to the University of Virginia in 1841 , resigning after a dispute with university authorities in 1842 . Back in England , he worked as an actuary , carrying out mathematical research in elimination theory in his spare time , before appointment as professor of mathematics at Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , in 1855 . After compulsory retirement aged 55 , he spent a few years writing poetry and enjoying his club before returning to the United States in 1876 as professor of mathematics at the newly opened Johns Hopkins University , in Baltimore , Maryland . The move reinvigorated his research on invariant theory and matrix theory ; he published the results in the American Journal of Mathematics , which he founded . During this time , he was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society . Homesick , he applied for the Savilian professorship ( Oxford having lifted the bar on Jewish academics ) and resigned from Johns Hopkins before receiving news of his appointment . He delayed his inaugural lecture until 1885 because he had difficulty finding a suitable topic . With his health failing , a deputy was appointed for him in 1892 ; he resigned in 1894 . The Royal Society inaugurated the Sylvester Medal in his honour in 1901",

                "Hardy was awarded a prize fellowship at Trinity College in 1900 , and published the first of his research papers ( which eventually totalled over 350 ) in the same year . His collaboration with J. E. Littlewood began in 1911 , a partnership described as the most famous in the history of mathematics , with more than 100 joint papers on topics such as distribution of prime numbers , mathematical analysis , analytic number theory , and solving the Waring problem . He also worked with the Indian mathematical prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan . He was a friend and colleague of the philosopher Bertrand Russell and was upset by Russell 's treatment by Cambridge for his pacifist views during the First World War . He was happier in Oxford , but returned to Cambridge in 1931 to take up the position of Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics . His contribution to population genetics is known as the Hardy-Weinberg principle , described by a biographer of Hardy ( the Cambridge mathematician B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s ) as one of the few exceptions to Hardy 's claim that nothing he had done , for good or ill , had made or was likely to make the least difference to the amenity of the world",

He was professor of pure mathematics at the University of Liverpool from 1929 until succeeding Hardy at Oxford in 1931 . As Titchmarsh ( unlike Hardy ) had said when applying that he was unwilling to lecture on geometry , one of the requirements of the Oxford chair , the stipulation was removed for him . He was a leading figure in Oxford mathematics thereafter , publishing extensively and winning the Sylvester Medal of the Royal Society in 1955 , but had little enthusiasm for lecturing",

    "intro": "The position of Savilian Professor of Geometry was established at the University of Oxford in 1619. It was founded (at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy) by Sir Henry Savile, a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College, reacting to what has been described by one 20th-century mathematician as the wretched state of mathematical studies in England at that time. He appointed Henry Briggs as the first professor. Edward Titchmarsh (professor 1931-63) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry, and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment, although the title of the chair was not changed. The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford since the late 19th century. Before then, for over 175 years until the middle of the 19th century, the geometry professors had an official residence adjoining the college in New College Lane. There have been 20 professors; Frances Kirwan, the current (as of 2019[update]) and first female holder of the chair, was appointed in 2017. The post has been held by a number of distinguished mathematicians. Briggs helped to develop the common logarithm, described as one of the most useful systems for mathematics. The third professor, John Wallis, introduced the use of \n\u221e\n{\\displaystyle \\infty }\n for infinity, and was regarded as one of the leading mathematicians of his time. Both Edmond Halley, who successfully predicted the return of the comet named in his honour, and his successor Nathaniel Bliss held the post of Astronomer Royal in addition to the professorship. Stephen Rigaud (professor 1810-27) has been called the foremost historian of astronomy and mathematics in his generation."
