    "intro": "This list includes the all-time and the active consecutive NFL playoff appearances. Aside from the NFL playoff appearance streaks, this list also includes Championship Game appearance streaks and the NFL championships win streak. Streaks from the AFL are also included. The New England Patriots hold the longest active consecutive playoff streak with 11 appearances, starting with the 2009-10 NFL playoffs, which is the longest of all-time. The Patriots have won three Super Bowls during this streak. The Dallas Cowboys hold the second consecutive playoff appearances record with nine appearances from 1975-1983. The Cowboys won one NFL championship during the streak. The Indianapolis Colts tied this record with nine straight appearances and one championship from 2002-2010. The Green Bay Packers hold the longest consecutive NFL title streak with three consecutive crowns. They did this once in the 1920s, before playoff games, and once in the 1960s, by winning seven playoff games during this three year championship streak. The Patriots hold the record for most consecutive playoff games won. From 2001-2005, New England won 10 games in a row, including 3 Super Bowls."
