    "intro": "The Scottish Junior Football East Region Premier League North also known for sponsorship reasons as the McBookie.com East Premier League North, is the second-tier division of the East Region of the Scottish Junior Football Association and sits parallel with the East Region Premier League South. The league came into existence under the 'North' name for the 2006-07 season, although a 'Tayside District league' had been in place below the East Super League since 2002-03, using the structure of a common 'East Region' top tier and lower regional divisions in place of the old structure of three separate regional leagues in that part of Scotland, with the Tayside Junior Football League the historic local competition. The North Division \nwas further expanded for 2013-14 season following league reconstruction in the East Region, by absorbing the more northerly clubs from the dissolved East Region Central Division. Up until season 2017-18, there was a Premier League at tier 2 and North and South Divisions at tier 3. The large-scale movement of clubs to the East of Scotland Football League has resulted in the structure being flattened. Further league reconstruction for the 2019-20 season split the Super League into North and South divisions, reducing the number of Premier League North teams. It now comprises 8 clubs who each play each other home and away to give 24 league fixtures."
