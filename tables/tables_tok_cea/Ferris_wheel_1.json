    "section_text": "Transportable Ferris wheels are designed to be operated at multiple locations , as opposed to fixed wheels which are usually intended for permanent installation . Small transportable designs may be permanently mounted on trailers , and can be moved intact . Larger transportable wheels are designed to be repeatedly dismantled and rebuilt , some using water ballast instead of the permanent foundations of their fixed counterparts . Fixed wheels are also sometimes dismantled and relocated . Larger examples include the original Ferris Wheel , which operated at two sites in Chicago , Illinois , and a third in St. Louis , Missouri ; Technocosmos/Technostar , which moved to Expoland , Osaka , after Expo '85 , Tsukuba , Ibaraki , for which it was built , ended ; and Cosmo Clock 21 , which added 5 metres ( 16 ft ) onto its original 107.5-metre ( 353 ft ) height when erected for the second time at Minato Mirai 21 , Yokohama , in 1999 . The world 's tallest transportable wheel today [ update ] is the 78-metre ( 256 ft ) Bussink Design R80XL . [ 145 ] [ 146 ] [ 147 ] [ 148 ] Roue de Paris , a Ronald Bussink R60 transportable wheel , at Geleen in the Netherlands in 2005 One of the most famous transportable wheels is the 60-metre ( 197 ft ) Roue de Paris , originally installed on the Place de la Concorde in Paris for the 2000 millennium celebrations . Roue de Paris left France in 2002 and in 2003\u201304 operated in Birmingham and Manchester , England . In 2005 it visited first Geleen then Amsterdam , Netherlands , before returning to England to operate at Gateshead . In 2006 it was erected at the Suan Lum Night Bazaar in Bangkok , Thailand , and by 2008 had made its way to Antwerp , Belgium . [ 149 ] Roue de Paris is a Ronald Bussink series R60 design using 40,000 litres ( 8,800 imperial gallons ; 11,000 US gallons ) of water ballast to provide a stable base . The R60 weighs 365 tonnes ( 402 short tons ) , and can be erected in 72 hours and dismantled in 60 hours by a specialist team . Transport requires seven 20-foot container lorries , ten open trailer lorries , and one closed trailer lorry . Its 42-passenger cars can be loaded either 3 or 6 at a time , and each car can carry 8 people . [ 150 ] Bussink R60 wheels have operated in Australia ( Brisbane ) , Canada ( Niagara Falls ) , France ( Paris ) , Malaysia ( Kuala Lumpur & Malacca ) , UK ( Belfast , Birmingham , Manchester , Sheffield ) , US ( Atlanta , Myrtle Beach ) , and elsewhere . Other notable transportable wheels include the 60-metre ( 197 ft ) Steiger Ferris Wheel , which was the world 's tallest transportable wheel when it began operating in 1980 . [ 151 ] It has 42 passenger cars , [ 152 ] and weighs 450 tons . [ 153 ] On October 11 , 2010 , it collapsed at the Kramermarkt in Oldenburg , Germany , during deconstruction . [ 154 ]",
    "uid": "Ferris_wheel_1",
    "intro": "A Ferris wheel is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating upright wheel with multiple passenger-carrying components (commonly referred to as passenger cars, cabins, tubs, capsules, gondolas, or pods) attached to the rim in such a way that as the wheel turns, they are kept upright, usually by gravity. Some of the largest modern Ferris wheels have cars mounted on the outside of the rim, with electric motors to independently rotate each car to keep it upright. These wheels are sometimes referred to as observation wheels and their cars referred to as capsules. However, these alternative names are also used for wheels with conventional gravity-oriented cars. The original Ferris Wheel was designed and constructed by George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. as a landmark for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The generic term Ferris wheel, now used in American English for all such structures, has become the most common type of amusement ride at state fairs in the United States. The current tallest Ferris wheel is the 167.6-metre (550 ft) High Roller in Las Vegas, Nevada, which opened to the public in March 2014."
