    "intro": "The 2010 Chicago Marathon took place on Sunday, October 10, 2010. Over 38,000 runners took part, the most in the race's history. Kenyan Samuel Wanjiru won the men's event with a time of 2:06:24, beating Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede by 19 seconds. Ethiopian Atsede Baysa won the women's event with a time of 2:23:40, beating Desiree Davlia by two minutes and forty seconds. On race day, Liliya Shobukhova crossed the finish line first in 2:20:25 more than 3 minutes ahead of Baysa but Shobukhova would eventually lose the title due to an anti-doping suspension. Wanjiru's win likely clinched him the men's championship, but Kebede could still take it if he wins or places second in the New York Marathon; this is considered unlikely since it is only four weeks from the Chicago Marathon. [needs update] Heinz Frei of Switzerland won the men's wheelchair event in 1:26:56 and American Amanda McGrory won the women's in 1:47:25. Richard Whitehead of Great Britain broke his old world record for athletes with lower-limb amputations, with a time of 2:42:52. Over six months before the race, organizers moved up the race's start-time by half an hour to 7:30 am to help prevent heat-related injuries like those that occurred in the 2007 when more than 300 runners were hospitalized. A red-flag warning was issued during the race, and sixty-five people were hospitalized, which is in line with other marathons. Despite the conditions, over 36,000 runners finished the 42.195-kilometer (26.219 mi) race, the most in Chicago Marathon history."
