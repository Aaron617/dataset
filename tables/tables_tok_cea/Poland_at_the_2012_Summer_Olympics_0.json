    "intro": "Poland competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's twentieth appearance at the Summer Olympics, having missed the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles because of the Soviet boycott. The Polish Olympic Committee (Polish: Polski Komitet Olimpijski, PKO) sent a total of 218 athletes to the Games, 130 men and 88 women, to compete in 22 sports. Poland left London with a total of 11 Olympic medals (3 gold, 2 silver, and 6 bronze), tying with Beijing for the nation's highest overall number of medals. Two of the medals were awarded to the team in athletics, sailing, and weightlifting. Among the nation's medalists were shot putter Tomasz Majewski, who successfully defended his Olympic title from Beijing, and double sculls pair Magdalena Fularczyk and Julia Michalska, who became the first Polish women to claim an Olympic rowing medal in 32 years. Windsurfers Przemys\u0142aw Miarczy\u0144ski and Zofia Klepacka recaptured their nation's success in sailing, as they each won the bronze medal. Several Polish athletes, however, suffered setbacks at these Olympic games. Tennis player Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska, who ranked second by the Women's Tennis Association, was surprisingly eliminated in the first round of women's singles. Meanwhile, the men's indoor volleyball team, champions of the 2012 FIVB World League, failed to advance into the semi-finals for the third consecutive time, after losing to Russia in the quarterfinals. Star sailor and double Olympic medalist Mateusz Kusznierewicz, and the men's quadruple sculls team, led by Micha\u0142 Jeli\u0144ski, finished outside of the medal standings in the final race."
