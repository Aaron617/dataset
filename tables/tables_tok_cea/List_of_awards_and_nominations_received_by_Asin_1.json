Though I have attended several award ceremonies and won several honours all these years, this was singularly unique for me. It was special even for my family. Being recognised by people in the place where you come from has special significance. Apart from her Filmfare awards, she has also won Santosham Best Actress Award for her performance in Shivamani 9848022338 and ITFA Best Actress Award for her portrayal of a Brahmin girl in Dasavathaaram."
