In the February 12 primary , Harris surged to a strong 44% to 32% victory . Gilchrest became the second incumbent Republican to be defeated by a candidate supported by the Club . The first was Rep. Joe Schwarz in Michigan in 2006 . [ 19 ] Harris was , however , unable to win the general election . In Georgia 's 10th congressional district , the Club 's PAC endorsed incumbent Paul Broun who defeated state representative Barry Fleming 71% to 29% in the July 15 , 2008 , primary election . Broun 's victory surprised many political observers . [ 95 ] In Arizona 's 5th congressional district , the Club 's PAC endorsed former Maricopa County Treasurer David Schweikert , who narrowly defeated former candidate Susan Bitter-Smith by a margin of 30% to 28% ; there were three other candidates . [ 96 ] He did not win the general election . During the 2008 Republican presidential primaries , the Club 's PAC was critical of Mike Huckabee , attacking him as the `` tax-increasing liberal governor of Arkansas '' . [ 97 ] Huckabee , in turn , referred to the Club for Growth as the `` Club for Greed '' . [ 98 ]",

    "intro": "The Club for Growth is a 501(c)(4) conservative organization active in the United States, with an agenda focused on cutting taxes and other economic issues. The Club has two political arms: an affiliated traditional political action committee, called the Club for Growth PAC, and Club for Growth Action, an independent-expenditure only committee or Super-PAC. According to its website, the Club for Growth's policy goals include cutting income tax rates, repealing the estate tax, supporting limited government and a balanced budget amendment, entitlement reform, free trade, tort reform, school choice, and deregulation. The group has opposed government action to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Club for Growth PAC endorses and raises money for candidates who meet its standards for fiscal conservatism. According to Politico, The Club for Growth is the pre-eminent institution promoting Republican adherence to a free-market, free-trade, anti-regulation agenda."
