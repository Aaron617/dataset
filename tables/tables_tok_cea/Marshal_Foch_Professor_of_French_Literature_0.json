                "Rudler had previously taught at the Sorbonne and at Bedford College , London . He was particularly interested in the life and works of Benjamin Constant , the subject of his doctoral thesis as well as later publications . He also published editions of works by Jean Racine and Moli\u00e8re , and studied the historian Jules Michelet . Rudler was the co-founder and first editor of the French Quarterly , a periodical that ran from 1919 to 1932 which was the first English-language periodical to cover French literary matters . He was regarded at Oxford as a devoted teacher , lecturing entirely in French and asking questions of his audience that had to be answered in French",

    "intro": "The position of Marshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford was founded in 1918 shortly after the end of the First World War. Ferdinand Foch, or Marshal Foch, was supreme commander of Allied forces from April 1918 onwards. The chair was endowed by an arms trader, Basil Zaharoff, in Foch's honour; he also endowed a post in English Literature at the University of Paris in honour of the British Field Marshal Earl Haig. Zaharoff wanted the University of Paris to have a right of veto over the appointment, but Oxford would not accept this. The compromise reached was that Paris should have a representative on the appointing committee (although this provision was later removed). In advance of the first election, St\u00e9phen Pichon (the French Foreign Minister) unsuccessfully attempted to influence the decision. The first professor, Gustave Rudler, was appointed in 1920. As of 2015[update], the chair is held by Catriona Seth. The position is held in conjunction with a Fellowship of All Souls College."
