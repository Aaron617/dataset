    "section_text": "Main article : 29th Canadian Ministry The Liberal Party of Canada won the federal election of October 19 , 2015 with a majority of seats in the House of Commons . The Cabinet was sworn-in on November 4 , with Justin Trudeau appointed as prime minister . The swearing in of the new Cabinet also marked the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canada 's history , where an equal number of female and male Ministers were appointed . [ 35 ] This was reflected in the fifteen women and fifteen men who were sworn into Cabinet on November 4 , for a total of thirty-one members , including the Prime Minister himself . Trudeau has continued to maintain a gender-balanced cabinet throughout several cabinet shuffles in his mandate , and the addition of five new ministerial positions . Initially , five members of Cabinet were appointed by orders-in-council on November 4 as ministers of state , but styled without the traditional of state in their titles . These were the Ministers of Science , [ 36 ] Small Business and Tourism , [ 37 ] Sport and Persons with Disabilities , [ 38 ] Status of Women , [ 39 ] and La Francophonie . [ 40 ] ( However , the new Minister of La Francophonie was , at the same time , appointed Minister of International Development . ) Ministers of state had previously represented a second order within the Cabinet ( determined by a lower salary as defined by the Salaries Act , [ 41 ] despite the Ministries and Ministers of State Act giving them full authority for any government function delegated to them . [ 42 ] However , after details of the aforementioned orders-in-council were published , the new cabinet stated its intent for there to `` be no levels of cabinet members '' and it would table in parliament amendments to the salary statutes , but also that the new ministers would continue to work with the existing departments rather than forming new ones . [ 43 ] On July 18 , 2018 Trudeau reshuffled his cabinet . This included adding 5 new ministry positions expanding the previous size of cabinet from 30 to 35 . [ 44 ] Ministers are listed according to the Canadian order of precedence : [ 45 ]",

    "intro": "The Cabinet of Canada (French: Cabinet du Canada) is a body of ministers of the Crown that, along with the Canadian monarch, and within the tenets of the Westminster system, forms the government of Canada. Chaired by the prime minister, the Cabinet is a committee of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and the senior echelon of the Ministry, the membership of the Cabinet and ministry often being co-terminal; as of November 2015[update] there are no members of the latter who are not also members of the former. For practical reasons, the Cabinet is informally referred to either in relation to the prime minister in charge of it or the number of ministries since Confederation. The current cabinet is the Cabinet of Justin Trudeau, which is part of the 29th Ministry. The interchangeable use of the terms cabinet and ministry is a subtle inaccuracy that can cause confusion."
