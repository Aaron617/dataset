Three weeks after he notified the company president of what he believed to be radiation safety violations , Gundersen was fired . According to The New York Times , for three years , Gundersen was awakened by harassing phone calls in the middle of the night and he became concerned about his family 's safety . Gundersen believes he was blacklisted , harassed and fired for doing what he thought was right . NES filed a $ 1.5 million defamation lawsuit against him that was settled out-of-court . A U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission report concluded that there had been irregularities at NES , and the Office of the Inspector General reported that the NRC had violated its own regulations by sending business to NES",

The unsafe procedures meant that spent fuel rod pools at Unit 1 had the potential to boil , possibly releasing radioactive steam . Galatis eventually took his concerns to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , to find that they had known about the unsafe procedures for years . As a result of going to the NRC , Galatis experienced subtle forms of harassment , retaliation , and intimidation . The NRC Office of Inspector General investigated this episode and essentially agreed with Galatis in Case Number 95-771 , the report of which tells the whole story . George Galatis was the subject of a Time magazine cover story on March 4 , 1996 . Millstone 1 was permanently closed in July 1998",

During the course of the trial , Olivieri became concerned about evidence that pointed to the toxicity of the study drug and to the drug being inefficacious . Olivieri informed both the research ethics board that was monitoring the study and Apotex , the drug maker . The research ethics board instructed Olivieri to inform participants about her concerns . Apotex responded by noting that Olivieri had signed a confidentiality agreement as part of the drug trial and that informing participants about her concerns , the validity of which Apotex disputed , would violate that confidentiality agreement . Apotex threatened to vigorously pursue all legal remedies against her if she disclosed her conclusions to patients . Olivieri disclosed her concerns to her patients and Apotex ended the portion of the study in which she was participating . In 1998 , the New England Journal of Medicine published her paper suggesting that deferiprone led to progressive hepatic fibrosis",

In 1993 , Parkinson became the key person on the Maralinga clean-up project , representing the then federal Labor government . By 1997 , however , there was much cost-cutting involved which compromised the project , and personal differences about how the project should proceed , which led to the sacking of Parkinson by the new Howard government . The clean-up was totally unsatisfactory according to Parkinson and he exposed the situation through the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , provoking a strong rebuttal and personal abuse from the government",
