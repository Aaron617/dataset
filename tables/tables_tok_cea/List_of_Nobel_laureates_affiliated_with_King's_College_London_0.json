    "intro": "The Nobel Prizes are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. Another prize, the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributors to the field of economics. Each prize is awarded by a separate committee: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years. In 1901, the winners of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. In 2008, the winners were awarded a prize amount of 10,000,000 SEK. The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. As of 2013, there have been 12 Nobel laureates affiliated with King's College London. King's College considers laureates who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate students or were members of the faculty as affiliated laureates. Charles Glover Barkla, who served as the Professor of Physics at King's College from 1909 to 1913, was the first King's College-affiliated laureate, winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1917. Nine of the Twelve King's College laureates were recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics or the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the remaining laureates being awarded for Chemistry, Peace and Literature."
