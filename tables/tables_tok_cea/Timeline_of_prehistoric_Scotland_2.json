    "section_text": "Eildon Hill \u2013 a triple peak and hill fort The four torcs in the Stirling hoard From the commencement of the Bronze Age to about 2000 BC , the archaeological record shows a decline in the number of large new stone buildings constructed . Pollen analyses suggest that at this time woodland increased at the expense of the area under cultivation . In Orkney , burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate . Bronze and Iron Age metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period . ( By contrast , the Neolithic monumental culture spread south from northern Scotland into England . ) As the Bronze Age developed , Scotland 's population grew to perhaps 300,000 in the second millennium BC . [ 64 ] [ 65 ] There were evidently significant differences between the lifestyles of Bronze Age peoples inhabiting Scotland . For example , finds at the Traprain Law site ( near modern Edinburgh ) suggest that the priests there may have overseen ceremonies on a par with their contemporaries on mainland Europe . On the other hand , although the mummifications found at Cladh Hallan in the Western Isles invite comparisons with Egypt , the simple lifestyle of the inhabitants of this settlement contrasts with that of Tutankamun \u2013 even if the former 's lives may have been preferable to those of the toiling slaves who built Amarna at this time . During the 1st millennium BC as the Iron Age emerged from the preceding Bronze Age , it becomes legitimate to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland , [ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] although the nature of the resident Pictish civilisation and their immediate predecessors remains enigmatic . The Stirling hoard was found by a metal detectorist in September 2009 . It has been described as the most significant discovery of Iron Age metalwork in Scotland and is said to be of international significance . [ 69 ]",

    "intro": "This timeline of prehistoric Scotland is a chronologically ordered list of important archaeological sites in Scotland and of major events affecting Scotland's human inhabitants and culture during the prehistoric period. The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus Homo is part of the geology of Scotland. Prehistory in Scotland ends with the arrival of the Romans in southern Scotland in the 1st century AD and the beginning of written records. The archaeological sites and events listed are the earliest examples or among the most notable of their type. No traces have yet been found of either a Neanderthal presence or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials, the first indications of humans in Scotland occurring only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC. Since that time, the landscape of Scotland has been altered dramatically by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney archipelago and many of the Inner Hebridean islands were attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the present-day North Sea was also dry land until after 4000 BC. Dogger Bank, for example was part of a large peninsula connected to the European continent. This would have made travel to western and northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task and there are numerous raised beaches around Scotland's coastline."
