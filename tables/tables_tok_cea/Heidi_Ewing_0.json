    "intro": "Heidi Ewing is a director, producer, and writer of documentary films. She and Rachel Grady founded Loki Films in 2001, and have collaborated on several documentaries together. She is best known as the co-director of Jesus Camp, which was nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary in 2006. Next came 12th & Delaware (HBO), which premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The film casts a heart-rending light on the abortion divide (LA Times) and was honored with a Peabody Award. Detropia, a poetic look at Ewing's home town, also won several awards, including Best Editing at Sundance 2012, Outstanding Direction and Outstanding Original Score, at the 2013 Cinema Eye Honors for Nonfiction Filmmaking and a News and Documentary Emmy for editing. Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You was the opening night selection of the 2016 Sundance Film Festival and premiered on PBS American Masters on October 25, 2016. Other films as a director include The Boys of Baraka, Freakonomics, and The Education of Mohammed Hussein."
