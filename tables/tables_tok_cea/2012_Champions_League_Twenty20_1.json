It was held in South Africa from 9 to 28 October 2012. This edition was significant for being the first to feature a Pakistani team. This was the first season to have Karbonn Mobiles as the title sponsor. They replaced Nokia, who withdrew from their four-year deal after just one year. The Sydney Sixers emerged the winners of the tournament, defeating the Highveld Lions in the final."
