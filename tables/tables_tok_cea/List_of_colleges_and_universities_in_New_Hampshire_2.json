    "intro": "This is a list of colleges and universities in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. For the purposes of this list, colleges and universities are defined as accredited,[a] degree-granting, postsecondary institutions. Currently, there are several universities and one law school, as well as a number of undergraduate associates and baccalaureate colleges operating in the state. In addition, four out-of-state institutions offer courses and degrees at locations in New Hampshire, and fifteen academic institutions were formerly active in the state. The state's five public universities are administered by the University System of New Hampshire, which is the largest provider of postsecondary education in the state. New Hampshire is also served by a network of seven public, technical community colleges. The oldest school in the state is Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League and the only New Hampshire institution founded before the American Revolution. The newest is the University of New Hampshire at Manchester, founded as a branch campus of the University of New Hampshire in 1985. Enrollment sizes range from small, liberal arts colleges with fewer than 100 students to the flagship state school University of New Hampshire in Durham, which serves over 14,000 on-campus students. The New Hampshire College & University Council is a consortium of 21 of the state's public and private institutions of higher education. The active institutions included on this list are all accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), with two exceptions. Antioch University New England is accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges and the Higher Learning Commission."
