It met in Columbus, Ohio from January 3, 2011 until December 20, 2012. While Ted Strickland was Ohio Governor for the first week of the biennium, John Kasich was sworn in during the second week. The apportionment of districts was based on the 2000 United States Census. This was the last time the 2000 census was used by the General Assembly to determine the apportionment of legislative districts. While the Ohio Senate was retained by the Ohio Republican Party, they won control of the Ohio House of Representatives from the Ohio Democratic Party."
