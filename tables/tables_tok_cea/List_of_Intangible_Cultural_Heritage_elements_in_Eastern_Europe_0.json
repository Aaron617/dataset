The event involves the performance of the folk drama Tsar Maximilian , a religious drama about Maximilian , the pagan tsar , and Afolf , his son . Children are chosen to perform as the characters dzad and babam , or old man and old lady . Each year , the celebration draws in around five hundred men , who take part by performing as tsars for families that have unwed daughters . Interest in the event is waning among the youth of the region , leading to concerns by UNESCO that the heritage will be lost",

    "intro": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) intangible cultural heritage elements are the non-physical traditions and practices performed by a people. As part of a country's cultural heritage, they include celebrations, festivals, performances, oral traditions, music, and the making of handicrafts. The intangible cultural heritage is defined by the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, drafted in 2003 and took effect in 2006. Inscription of new heritage elements on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists is determined by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, an organisation established by the convention. Eastern Europe, as designated by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), consists of ten countries. The groupings used by the UNSD are not indicative of any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories. All of the countries, with the exception of Russia, are state parties to the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Four intangible cultural heritage elements have been inscribed as elements of the Czech Republic, two as elements of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Russia, one for Belarus and Slovakia, and none for Moldova, Poland, and Ukraine."
