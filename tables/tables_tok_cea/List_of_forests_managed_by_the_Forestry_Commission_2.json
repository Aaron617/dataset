In 2013 the Commission's forests in Wales were transferred to Natural Resources Wales, whilst Forestry and Land Scotland was established in Scotland in 2019 to own and manage Scotland's National Forest Estate. These forests range from small scale urban forests to many of the largest forests in Britain. The Forestry Commission was set up in 1919 to carry out afforestation programmes across Britain for timber production. It is also responsible for maintaining and developing recreational facilities within the forests."
