The tserkvas bear testimony to a distinct building tradition rooted in Orthodox ecclesiastic design interwoven with elements of local tradition , and symbolic references to their communities cosmogony . The tserkvas are built on a tri-partite plan surmounted by open quadrilateral or octagonal domes and cupolas . They feature wooden bell towers , iconostasis screens , and interior polychrome decorations as well as churchyards , gatehouses and graveyards",
