In the year 44 he was beheaded in Jerusalem and his remains were later transferred to Galicia in a stone boat . The king Alfonso II of Asturias ordered the construction of a chapel in 810s in the place . This chapel was followed by a first church in 829 and later by a pre-Romanesque church on 899 , gradually becoming an important place of pilgrimage . In 997 this primitive church was reduced to ashes by Almanzor , commander of the army of the Caliphate of Cordoba . The construction of the current cathedral in the same place was built between 1075 and 1122 under the reign of Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile . The baroque fa\u00e7ade of Obradoiro was made in 1740 ; also baroque is that of Acibechar\u00eda ; that of Pratar\u00edas was built by Master Esteban in 1103 ; the P\u00f3rtico da Gloria , a primordial work of Romanesque sculpture , completed by Master Mateo in 1188",

The Holy Forty Martyrs Church , an elongated six-columned basilica , has three semicircular apses and a narrow narthex from the west . Another building was added later to the west side of the church . The church interior was covered with mural painting probably in 1230 . On the western addition some of the outer decoration survived revealing the traditional arches and coloured small ceramic plates inserted into the wall . It is not clear if the church has frescoes painted on the outer walls . Some of the Bulgarian Empire 's most significant historical records are stored in the church , including Omurtag 's Column , Asen 's Column and the Border Column from Rodosto from the rule of Khan Krum",

Located on top of the fortified Tsarevets hill in the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire , the cathedral was the seat of the Bulgarian patriarch from its construction in the 11th-12th century to its destruction in 1393 . Standing on top of a late Roman church , the cathedral , reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s , follows a cross-domed plan with a bell tower and a triple apse . Richly decorated on both the exterior and interior , its internal walls now feature modern frescoes , the presence of which has meant that it has not been reconsecrated . Though not active as a Christian place of worship , it has been open for visitors since 1985",

    "intro": "This article lists some but by no means all of the oldest known church buildings in the world. In most instances, buildings listed here were reconstructed numerous times and only fragments of the original buildings have survived. These surviving freestanding buildings were purposely constructed for use by congregations (or used at an early date). The dates are the approximate dates when they were first used by congregations for worship. Church may be used in the sense of Christian denomination or in the singular as the Christian Church as a whole. The church (ecclesia, assembly) is traced to Pentecost and the beginning of the Christian mission in the first century and was not used in reference to a building. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia the Cenacle (the site of the Last Supper) in Jerusalem was the first Christian church. Archaeology magazine suggests that the Dura-Europos church in Syria is the oldest surviving church building in the world. While Jordan's Aqaba Church is considered to be the world's first purpose-built church. Several authors have cited the Etchmiadzin Cathedral (Armenia's mother church) as the oldest cathedral. Also St. Thaddeus Monastery or Qara Kelisa (means black church) in Chaldoran County, Iran is noted by UNESCO World Heritage Centre as related to the 66 AD. According to Armenian tradition such a location was chosen because saint Thaddeus built the earliest church--parts of which are still believed to be in place as the base of the old section--upon the ruins of the temple."
