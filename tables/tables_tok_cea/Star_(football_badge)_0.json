    "intro": "In football, some national and club teams include one or more stars as part of (or beside) the team badge (often referred to as a crest) appearing on their shirt, to represent important trophies the team has previously won. Often this is a unilateral decision by a team itself, rather than a specific privilege earned or sanctioned by any governing body (e.g. as with the FIFA Champions Badge), and as such, the relevance of these stars on a club's shirt is somewhat tenuous."
