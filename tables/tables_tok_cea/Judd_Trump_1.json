    "intro": "Judd Trump (born 20 August 1989) is an English professional snooker player from Bristol and the reigning World Champion. He enjoyed considerable success in youth tournaments before turning professional in 2005. On 3 April 2011, he won his first ranking title, beating Mark Selby 10-8 in the final of the China Open. Following his success in China, he reached the final of the 2011 World Championship where he finished runner-up to John Higgins. He then won the 2011 UK Championship, defeating Mark Allen 10-8 in the final to claim his first Triple Crown title. In November 2012, Trump won the inaugural International Championship and in doing so he became world number one, a position he held for five weeks; he reclaimed the top spot on 18 February 2013. He won his fourth ranking title at the Australian Goldfields Open in July 2014, defeating Neil Robertson 9-5 in the final. He won the inaugural 2015 World Grand Prix with a 10-7 final victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan. He has accrued three Championship League titles (2009, 2014, 2016) as well as a second win at the China Open in April 2016. He achieved two consecutive wins at the European Masters; in October 2016, he defeated O'Sullivan 9-8 to claim the title, which he successfully defended the following season by defeating Stuart Bingham 9-7. Trump claimed the Masters title in January 2019, again defeating O'Sullivan 10-4 in the final. In May 2019, he completed his career Triple Crown by winning the World Snooker Championship for the first time, beating Higgins 18-9 in what was described by some commentators as the highest-quality final ever played."
