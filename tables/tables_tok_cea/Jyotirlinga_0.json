                "Bhimashankar is very much debated . There is a Bhimashankara temple near Pune ( pictured ) in Maharashtra , which was referred to as Daakini country , but Kashipur in Uttarakhand was also referred to as Daakini country in ancient days and a Bhimashkar Temple known as Shree Moteshwar Mahadev is present there . Another Bhimashankar is in the Sahyadri range of Maharashtra . The Bhimashankar temple near Guwahati , Assam is the jyotirlinga according to Sivapuran . According to Linga Purana , Bhimasankar temple in Bhimpur near Gunupur of Rayagada district in South Orissa is also believed as Bhimasankar Jyotirlinga , which is situated at the western part of the holy Mahendragiri mountains and at the river bank of Mahendratanaya ( which is also believed as the Daakini area by many historian ) , was excavated in the year 1974 , having quadrangular Shakti around the Linga and decorated by a Upavita as per the puran",
