    "section_text": "A microbrewery , or craft brewery , is a modern brewery which produces a limited amount of beer , usually with an orientation toward distinctive and flavourful products . In Australia , there is no strict definition for a microbrewery ; however , the definition for membership of the Independent Brewers Association provides a fair guide that could be considered appropriate . That is , a brewer sells less than 40 million litres of beer per annum and is not more than 20% owned by a brewer that produces more than 40 million litres of beer per annum anywhere in the world . [ 20 ] The following is a list of notable microbreweries in Australia , listed alphabetically . In July 2017 , there was approximately 500 small breweries in Australia . [ 21 ]",

    "intro": "Beer production in Australia has traditionally been dominated by regional producers. Since the 1980s there has been a steady stream of takeovers and amalgamations, and now the two major producers (who were once Australian-owned) are Carlton & United Breweries (CUB) and Lion. In December 2011, CUB became a subsidiary of British multinational SABMiller (the world's then-second-largest international brewing company) and in October 2016 CUB became 100% owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) the world's largest brewing company, based in Belgium. Since October 2009, Lion has been a subsidiary of Japanese brewer, Kirin Holdings Company Limited a brewing company established in 1885. The largest remaining Australian owned brewer is Coopers Brewery with a market share of about 4% of total beer volume sales in Australia. The two foreign-owned companies accounted for 89% of beer volume sales in 2011, with CUB's market share at 48% (declining from a 55% market share in 2006) and Lion Nathan at 41% (increasing from 37%). In May 2012 the dominant Australian-produced beers were XXXX Gold, which accounted for 12.4% of all beer consumed in Australia, VB, with 12.3%, Carlton Draught 9.3%, Tooheys New 7.1%, Tooheys Extra Dry 4.4% and Carlton Mid 3.8%."
