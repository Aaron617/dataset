    "intro": "Star Wars: The Vintage Collection is a Star Wars basic action figures toy line produced by the Hasbro company, and released under their Kenner brand. The line features modern 'super-articulated' figures in product packaging nearly identical to that of the original Kenner toy series marketed from 1978 until 1984. The Vintage Collection started in the summer of 2010 and continued with new releases throughout 2012. It was preceded by limited 'vintage' style figure issues that were part of The Original Trilogy Collection (2004) and The Saga Collection (2006) lines. Hasbro announced at San Diego Comic-Con International 2012 that The Vintage Collection would go on hiatus for two years (its return to coincide with the 3-D re-releases of the original Star Wars Trilogy starting in 2015), however, that schedule fell in flux after to the planned release of Star Wars Episode VII in 2015, and the line was discontinued. At Star Wars Celebration Orlando 2017, it was revealed that the line would make a comeback for 2018. The first figure revealed for the lineup was Rey from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In May 2017, it was announced that Doctor Aphra from Marvel's Star Wars: Darth Vader comic book had won a fan poll to be included in the line as well. The toyline officially made its return on April 13, 2018."
