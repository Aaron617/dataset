    "intro": "This is a list of Methodist churches in the United States. It includes notable churches either where a church means a congregation (in the New Testament definition) or where a church means a building (in the colloquial sense). It also includes campgrounds and conference centers and retreats that are significant Methodist gathering places, including a number of historic sites of camp meetings. This very limited list includes only historically or architecturally significant buildings, and omits many of the currently very largest and influential congregations which do not meet that standard. Methodism was founded with a large component being a rejection of past churches and was developed by John Wesley and others in large open-air gatherings in Great Britain. In the United States, Methodists (along with Baptists and other Protestants) were major participants in the Second Great Awakening wherein people would travel from a large area to a particular site to camp out, listen to itinerant preachers, and pray. The list also includes selected notable Methodist theological buildings. In the United States, numerous Methodist churches are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and on state and local historic registers, many reflecting the values of plainness, of Gothic architecture, of simple adornment. The Greek Revival style is also simple and came to be adopted for numerous American Methodist churches."
