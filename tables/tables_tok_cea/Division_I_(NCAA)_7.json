    "section_text": "The NCAA has limits on the total financial aid each Division I member may award in each sport that the school sponsors . It divides sports that are sponsored into two types for purposes of scholarship limitations : `` Head-count '' sports , in which the NCAA limits the total number of individuals that can receive athletic scholarships , but allows each player to receive up to a full scholarship . `` Equivalency '' sports , in which the NCAA limits the total financial aid that a school can offer in a given sport to the equivalent of a set number of full scholarships . Roster limitations may or may not apply , depending on the sport . The term `` counter '' is also key to this concept . The NCAA defines a `` counter '' as `` an individual who is receiving institutional financial aid that is countable against the aid limitations in a sport . `` [ 33 ]",

    "intro": "NCAA Division I (D-I) is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States. D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers, with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities and more athletic scholarships than Divisions II and III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition. This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA, in contrast to the lower level College Division; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973. The University Division was renamed Division I, while the College Division was split in two; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II, while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III. For college football only, D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), and those institutions that do not have any football program. FBS teams have higher game attendance requirements and more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams. The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games, with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games, while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament. For the 2014-15 school year, Division I contained 345 of the NCAA's 1,066 member institutions, with 125 in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), 125 in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), and 95 non-football schools, with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I. There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012, after which any school that wants to move to D-I must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the NCAA it has the financial ability to support a D-I program."
