    "section_text": "Before transistors were invented , relays were used in early computers . The world 's first working programmable , fully automatic digital computer , [ 250 ] the 1941 Z3 22-bit word length computer , had 2,600 relays , and operated at a clock frequency of about 4\u20135 Hz . The 1940 Complex Number Computer had fewer than 500 relays , [ 251 ] but it was not fully programmable . The second generation of computers were transistor computers that featured boards filled with discrete transistors and magnetic memory cores . The experimental 1953 48-bit Transistor Computer , developed at the University of Manchester , is widely believed to be the first transistor computer to come into operation anywhere in the world ( the prototype had 92 point-contact transistors and 550 diodes ) . [ 252 ] A later version the 1955 machine had a total of 250 junction transistors and 1300 point diodes . The Computer also used a small number of tubes in its clock generator , so it was not the first fully transistorized . The ETL Mark III , developed at the Electrotechnical Laboratory in 1956 , may have been the first transistor-based electronic computer using the stored program method . It had about `` 130 point-contact transistors and about 1,800 germanium diodes were used for logic elements , and these were housed on 300 plug-in packages which could be slipped in and out . [ 253 ] The 1958 decimal architecture IBM 7070 was the first transistor computer to be fully programmable . It had about 30,000 alloy-junction germanium transistors and 22,000 germanium diodes , on approximately 14,000 Standard Modular System ( SMS ) cards . The 1959 MOBIDIC , short for `` MOBIle DIgital Computer '' , at 12,000 pounds ( 6.0 short tons ) mounted in the trailer of a semi-trailer truck , was a transistorized computer for battlefield data . The third generation of computers used integrated circuits ( ICs ) . [ 254 ] The 1962 15-bit Apollo Guidance Computer used `` about 4,000 `` Type-G '' ( 3-input NOR gate ) circuits '' for about 12,000 transistors plus 32,000 resistors . [ 255 ] The first commercial IC-based computer was the IBM System/360 in 1964 . [ 254 ] The 1965 12-bit PDP-8 CPU had 1409 transistors and over 10,000 diodes . It was not a microprocessor , as it used discrete transistors on many cards ; but later microprocessors , such as the Intersil 6100 reimplemented it , see below . [ 256 ] The next generation of computers were the microcomputers , also known as home computers or personal computers ( PC ) , which used MOS microprocessors , in the 1970s . This list includes early transistorized computers ( second generation ) and IC-based computers ( third generation ) from the 1950s and 1960s .",

    "intro": "The transistor count is the number of transistors on an integrated circuit (IC). It typically refers to the number of MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOS transistors) on an IC chip, as all modern ICs use MOSFETs. It is the most common measure of IC complexity (although the majority of transistors in modern microprocessors are contained in the cache memories, which consist mostly of the same memory cell circuits replicated many times). The rate at which MOS transistor counts have increased generally follows Moore's law, which observed that the transistor count doubles approximately every two years. As of 2019[update], the largest transistor count in a commercially available microprocessor is 39.54 billion MOSFETs, in AMD's Zen 2 based Epyc Rome, which is a 3D integrated circuit (with eight dies in a single package) fabricated using TSMC's 7 nm FinFET semiconductor manufacturing process. As of 2018[update], the highest transistor count in a graphics processing unit (GPU) is Nvidia's GV100 Volta with 21.1 billion MOSFETs, manufactured using TSMC's 12 nm FinFET process. As of 2019[update], the highest transistor count in any IC chip is Samsung's 1 TB eUFS (3D-stacked) V-NAND flash memory chip, with 2 trillion floating-gate MOSFETs (4 bits per transistor). As of 2019, the highest transistor count in a non-memory chip is a deep learning engine called the Wafer Scale Engine by Cerebras, using a special design to route around any non-functional core on the device; it has 1.2 trillion MOSFETs, manufactured using TSMC's 16 nm FinFET process. In terms of computer systems that consist of numerous integrated circuits, the supercomputer with the highest transistor count as of 2016[update] is the Chinese-designed Sunway TaihuLight, which has for all CPUs/nodes (1012 for the 10 million cores and for RAM 1015 for the 1.3 million GB) combined about 400 trillion transistors in the processing part of the hardware and the DRAM includes about 12 quadrillion transistors, and thats about 97 percent of all the transistors. To compare, the smallest computer, as of 2018[update] dwarfed by a grain of sand, has on the order of 100,000 transistors, and the one, fully programmable, with the fewest transistors ever has 130 transistors or fewer. In terms of the total number of transistors in existence, it has been estimated that a total of 13 sextillion (1.3 \u00d7 1022) MOSFETs have been manufactured worldwide between 1960 and 2018, accounting for at least 99.9% of all transistors. This makes the MOSFET the most widely manufactured device in history."
