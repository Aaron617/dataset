It took place on December 13 , 2003 . The main feud going into the Cage of Death match was between Team Zandig ( John Zandig , Nick Gage , Ian Knoxx , Wifebeater , and Lobo ) and the HI-V The Messiah , Adam Flash , Nate Hatred , Trent Acid , Johnny Kashmere , and B-Boy ) . Although Team Zandig 's sixth member was New Jack , he turned on Team Zandig and joined the HI-V . The Cage match also differed from the previous year , in that there were two rings ; one of them was surrounded by the cage , and the other was filled with thumbtacks ( which in kayfabe storyline was claimed to be `` one million '' ) . Above the two rings was scaffolding walkway on which the wrestlers could walk on . The match started with two members of each team , and every 90 seconds a wrestler , from either team , entered the match according to the number they drew before the match started . Elimination occurred when both a wrestlers ' feet hit the floor .",
