    "intro": "Country Week or Country Senior High Schools Carnival is an annual multi-sport event carnival held in Perth, Western Australia between rural high schools from Western Australia. The carnival is organised by School Sport WA. The carnival includes sports such as Australian rules football, hockey, soccer, netball, volleyball and basketball in a range of divisions. Non-sporting competitions in areas such as speech, debating and dance have also been added to the event schedule. Country Week is recognised as being the biggest event of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The event typically involves about 40 schools with around 3,000 students and over 200 teachers and support staff. The carnival is held toward the end of the second school term in late June and early July and lasts for one week. The Amanda Young Foundation has supported the event by donating water bottles to all participating students. The bottles carry messages about the dangers of sharing water bottles to prevent the spread of meningococcal disease. In 2015 the number of participants at the carnival was approximately 3,700, with the RAC sponsoring the event distributing water bottles as part of a road safety campaign, highlighting the over representation of young drivers dying on country roads."
