Within the CCCPC is the Politburo of the Communist Party of China . This body is a group of 25 individuals ( currently 23 men and two women ) who govern the Communist Party of China ( CCP ) . Theoretically , the Politburo is elected by the CCCPC ; however , in practice any new member of the Politburo is chosen by the current members . Politburo members hold positions in China 's national government and regional positions of power simultaneously thereby consolidating the CCP \u2019 s power . In the case of key policy decisions , topics are addressed in the Politburo which then determines actions to be taken by the national and local government . The policy direction for the entire country rests in the hands of these 25 individuals who meet together once a month . Admission into the Politburo is extremely difficult . Tight control over the body is exercised by current members who vet potential members carefully to maintain the balance of power . Good political relationships within the Politburo are essential for admittance into the group . All members of the Politburo are elected for five year terms .

Despite the guarantee of universal franchise in the constitution, the appointment of the Paramount Leader lies largely in the hands of his predecessor and the powerful factions that control the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The appointment of the leader of the worlds most populous country occurs after two five year terms in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China."
