    "intro": "The New Jersey Devils are an American professional ice hockey team based in Newark, New Jersey. They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Devils entered the League as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974. After just two years in Kansas City, they moved to Denver, Colorado, where they were known as the Colorado Rockies. In 1982, the team moved again to New Jersey. They currently play their home games at the Prudential Center. The franchise and its members have won numerous team and individual awards and honors. They have captured the Prince of Wales Trophy as the Eastern Conference playoff champion five times, while they have also won Stanley Cup three times, in 1995, 2000 and 2003. Former goaltender Martin Brodeur is the team's most decorated player, having won the Vezina Trophy four times and the William M. Jennings Trophy five times, and the Calder Memorial Trophy once, along with several selections to the NHL First and Second All-Star teams. Scott Stevens played in ten NHL All-Star Games, more than any player in team history. Taylor Hall is the only player in franchise history to have won the Hart Memorial Trophy. Five players have had their numbers retired by the team."
