About 70 gunmen linked to the extremist Abu Sayyaf group fired grenade launchers and automatic rifles on houses , and torched others while residents were sleeping , killing one government-armed militiaman and 10 civilians in the village of Tubigan on the island of Basilan . The regional health chief confirmed that seventeen people were wounded in the attack , with nine in a critical condition , including four children . Several of those critically wounded died later in Zamboanga City hospitals . The attack followed the killing of an Abu Sayyaf commander and the arrest of two key members and government forces had been warned to be on alert for reprisal attacks . Lieutenant General Ben Dolorfino , chief of the military 's Western Mindanao Command , indicated that a clan war was the apparent motive in the killings and the attack had been motivated by a personal grudge with the village chairman",

The first bomb detonated inside a van about 10:30 am outside an education department building and opposite a sports stadium . The second , rigged to a motorcycle left near a Roman Catholic church , exploded minutes later and heavily damaged the building . The bombings ignited gun battles around the city between rebels and security forces , with the militants allegedly targeting helpless civilians seeking cover . A civilian was briefly held hostage while some militants fled and third bomb placed near a judge 's house opposite a bus terminal was safely detonated later by soldiers . The city mayor , Cherry Akbar , stated almost all of the 14 fatalities were caused by small arms fire , including at least four militants , one of whom apparently perished in the first blast . Two injured suspects were arrested after the attack and interrogated , giving an account that they had been hired",

                "Four civilians died and six were wounded in an afternoon attack by about 30 hooded attackers on a commuter jeep going home from Basilan 's capital of Isabela City , through the township of Maluso . The attackers , believed to be Abu Sayyaf militants , fired from a hill with rifles onto the jeepney , killing two passengers instantly . Other commuters were struck and killed by bullets as they tried to flee . Police chief for the island province of Basilan , Antonio Mendoza , also confirmed a 10-year-old boy who survived the attack had been struck repeatedly by a machete . The al-Qaeda linked militants may have staged the attack to divert government troops from a week-long offensive in a nearby town",

As suicide bombings have not been known to happen before in the Philippines , police were investigating the theory that the suspected bomber was not a suicide bomber in the usual sense , but a proxy who may not have known he was carrying a remotely detonated weapon . The Governor of Sulu , Sakur Tan , stated that the bomb may have been intended for him as he arrived from Manila , however Army officers believe the attack had been linked to the U.S. ambassador 's visit to Zamboanga , scheduled for 6 August and cancelled for security reasons",

The bomb is believed to have been hidden inside a bag , placed in an overhead luggage compartment at the rear of the bus , and detonated soon after a group of men who were suspected to have planted it exited the vehicle . An ordnance team stated it appeared to have been an 81 mm mortar round that was remotely detonated using mobile phones . A previous bus bombing in the vicinity of Matalam , in 2007 , was attributed to the al-Khobar group , a gang of former Muslim insurgents that had taken to extortion . They are the prime suspects in the 2010 attack as the bus company involved in the bombing had been targeted for extortion in the past",
