    "intro": "The thirteenth season of Dancing with the Stars Australia premiered live on 1 October 2013. Daniel MacPherson continued his role as main host of the show on Channel Seven. However, Melanie Brown had announced she wouldn't be returning for her second season as co-host, in order to pursue a judging role on America's Got Talent. Sunrise weather presenter, Edwina Bartholomew permanently replaced Brown for this season. Todd McKenney and Helen Richey confirmed their returns as judges whilst, Joshua Horner resigned from the panel after two seasons. It was later revealed that two new judges will both replace Horner. Former champion and current Dancing with the Stars USA professional, Kym Johnson and actor/tap dancer Adam Garcia became the newest additions to the judges table, alongside McKenney and Richey. Twelve contestants and professional dancers participated in this season. The celebrities cast were revealed on 27 August 2013, via the networkers website, along with their professional partners and on Today Tonight. This season also marks the show's return to the Tuesday 7.30pm timeslot as it has not been presented in this format since season 7. This was the first time three professional dancers had suffered injuries in the same season; however, only one, Dannial Gosper, permanently withdrew from the show. On 26 November 2013, Cosentino and professional partner, Jessica Raffa were crowned champions for this season, defeating two female finalists Rhiannon Fish and Tina Arena, who both managed runner-up and third place respectively."
