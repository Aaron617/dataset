In 1971 , Vladimir Bukovsky smuggled to the West a file of 150 pages documenting the political abuse of psychiatry , which he sent to The Times . The documents were photocopies of forensic reports on prominent Soviet dissidents . In January 1972 , Bukovsky was convicted of spreading anti-Soviet propaganda under Criminal Code , mainly on the ground that he had , with anti-Soviet intention , circulated false reports about political dissenters confined in mental hospitals . Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union was denounced in the course of the Congresses of the World Psychiatric Association in Mexico City ( 1971 ) , Hawaii ( 1977 ) , Vienna ( 1983 ) and Athens ( 1989 )",

Bridenbaugh ( known as the GE Three ) blew the whistle on safety problems at nuclear power plants , and their action has been called an exemplary instance of whistleblowing . The three engineers gained the attention of journalists and their disclosures about the threats of nuclear power had a significant impact . They timed their statements to coincide with their resignations from responsible positions in General Electric 's nuclear energy division , and later established themselves as consultants on the nuclear power industry for state governments , federal agencies , and overseas governments . The consulting firm they formed , MHB Technical Associates , was technical advisor for the movie , The China Syndrome . The three engineers participated in Congressional hearings which their disclosures precipitated",
