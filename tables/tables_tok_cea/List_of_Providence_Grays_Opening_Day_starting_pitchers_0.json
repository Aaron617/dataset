    "intro": "The Providence Grays were a Major League Baseball team that was based in Providence, Rhode Island and played in the National League from 1878 through 1885. The Grays used four Opening Day starting pitchers in their eight years as a Major League Baseball franchise. The first game of the new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor that is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Grays had a record of five wins and three losses in their Opening Day games. The first game in Providence Grays history was played on May 1, 1878 against the Boston Red Caps (now known as the Atlanta Braves). Fred Corey was the Opening Day starting pitcher in that game, which the Grays lost by a score of 1-0. The Grays' last Opening Day game was played on May 2, 1885 against the Philadelphia Phillies. Charles Radbourn was the Grays' Opening Day starting pitcher in that game, which the Grays won by a score of 8-2. Four pitchers made Opening Day starts for the Grays. Baseball Hall of Famer Monte Ward made four Opening Day starts in the Grays' eight seasons. Radbourne, also a Baseball Hall of Famer, made two Opening Day starts for the Grays. Thus, in six of the Grays' eight seasons (75%), the Grays' Opening Day starting pitcher was a Baseball Hall of Famer."
