    "intro": "The History of Michigan Wolverines football in the Crisler years covers the history of the University of Michigan Wolverines football program during the period from the hiring of Fritz Crisler as head coach in 1938 through his retirement as head coach after winning the 1948 Rose Bowl. Michigan was a member of the Big Ten Conference during the Crisler years and played its home games at Michigan Stadium. During the 10 years in which Crisler served as head football coach, Michigan compiled a record of 71-16-3 (.806). Tom Harmon played for the Wolverines from 1938 to 1940 and in 1940 became the first Michigan player to win the Heisman Trophy. The 1947 Michigan team, sometimes known as the Mad Magicians, compiled a perfect 10-0 record, outscored its opponents 394-53, defeated the USC Trojans 49-0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl game, and were selected as the nation's No. 1 team by a 226-119 margin over Notre Dame in an unprecedented AP Poll taken after the bowl games. Bob Chappuis finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1947. Ten players from the Crisler years have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. They are Chappuis, Bump Elliott, Pete Elliott, Harmon, Elroy Crazy Legs Hirsch, David M. Nelson (inducted as coach), Tubby Raymond (inducted as coach), and Bob Westfall, Albert Ox Wistert, and Alvin Moose Wistert. Two have also been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame - Hirsch and Len Ford. Three members of the coaching staff have also been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. They are Crisler, Clarence Biggie Munn, and Bennie Oosterbaan (inducted as player)."
