    "intro": "The Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup was an annual professional wrestling memorial show produced by Full Impact Pro (FIP) promotion, typically between October and December. The event was established to honor the memory of independent wrestler All American Jeff Peterson who died at age 21 after a two-year battle with leukemia. A rising star in the National Wrestling Alliance at the time of his death, his home promotion NWA Florida held a memorial tournament, co-hosted by IPW Hardcore, presented by his friends and fellow Florida wrestlers. The first show was held on May 16-17, 2003, at the Florida WrestlePlex in St. Petersburg, Florida. It is the longest-running tournament in the Southeastern United States followed by CWF Mid-Atlantic's Johnny Weaver Memorial Tournament. It was a standard 16-man single-elimination tournament intended to showcase the top junior heavyweight wrestlers from independent promotions throughout the United States and Japan. Many top indy wrestlers have participated in the event\n with former winners including Reckless Youth (2003), Justice(2004), Chris Sabin (2005), Milano Collection AT (2006), and Chris Hero (2007), Erick Stevens (2008), Davey Richards (2009), and Sami Callihan (2010). The tournament was originally held by NWA Florida from 2003 to 2005, when it closed, and was continued by Full Impact Pro the following year. Both promotions held a combined 9 Memorial Cup tournaments. The tenth tournament on December 14 and 15, 2012, was billed as the last ever Jeff Peterson Memorial Cup and was an independent internet pay-per-view not officially held by any promotion. No wrestler has ever won the tournament twice, but multiple wrestlers have participated in the event more than once. The event has also featured other wrestling personalities."
