    "intro": "The district of Tandridge, the easternmost of 11 local government districts in the English county of Surrey, has more than 70 current and former places of worship. Religious buildings dating from every age between the Norman era and the present are found across the area, which is characterised by small towns and ancient hamlets. A range of architectural styles and materials are represented: from Surrey's only Perpendicular Gothic church of any size or pretension (at Lingfield) to small weatherboarded buildings, tin tabernacles and modern brick chapels. As of 2020, 61 places of worship are in use in the district and a further 11 former churches and chapels no longer hold religious services but survive in alternative uses. Christianity is the majority religion in Tandridge, and the Church of England - the country's Established Church - is represented by the largest number of churches. Several congregations of Roman Catholics, Methodists, Baptists and the United Reformed Church also meet at their own buildings in the main towns and elsewhere; and various other Protestant Nonconformist denominations are accommodated in chapels and meeting rooms of different styles and ages. Jehovah's Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints both have large places of worship of regional importance in the district. English Heritage has awarded listed status to 28 places of worship in the district of Tandridge. A building is defined as listed when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of special architectural or historic interest in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, is responsible for this; English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of the department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status: Grade I, the highest, is defined as being of exceptional interest; Grade II* is used for particularly important buildings of more than special interest; and Grade II, the lowest, is used for buildings of special interest. As of February 2001, there were 20 buildings with Grade I status, 52 with Grade II* status and 519 with Grade II status in the district."
