    "section_text": "The 1867 reform , initiated after the failure of the January Uprising , was designed to tie Congress Poland ( now de facto the Vistulan Country ) more tightly to the administration structure of the Russian Empire . It divided larger governorates into smaller ones . A new lower level entity , gmina , was introduced . This time ten governorates were formed :",

    "intro": "Congress Poland was subdivided several times from its creation in 1815 until its dissolution in 1918. Congress Poland (Russian Poland) was divided into departments, a relic from the times of the French-dominated Duchy of Warsaw. In 1816 the administrative divisions were changed to forms that were more traditionally Polish: voivodeships, obw\u00f3ds and powiats. Following the November Uprising, the subdivisions were again changed in 1837 to bring the subdivisions closer to the structure of the Russian Empire when guberniyas (governorates) were introduced. In this way, Congress Poland was gradually transformed into the Vistulan Country. Over the next several decades, various smaller reforms were carried out, either changing the smaller administrative units or merging/splitting various guberniyas."
