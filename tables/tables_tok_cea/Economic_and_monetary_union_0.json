    "intro": "An economic and monetary union (MCU) is a type of trade bloc that features a combination of a common market, customs union, and monetary union. Established via a trade pact, an MCU constitutes the sixth of seven stages in the process of economic integration. An MCU agreement usually combines a customs union with a common market. A typical MCU establishes free trade and a common external tariff throughout its jurisdiction. It is also designed to protect freedom in the movement of goods, services, and people. This arrangement is distinct from a monetary union (e.g., the Latin Monetary Union), which does not usually involve a common market. As with the economic and monetary union established among the 28 member states of the European Union (EU), an MCU may affect different parts of its jurisdiction in different ways. Some areas are subject to separate customs regulations from other areas subject to the MCU. These various arrangements may be established in a formal agreement, or they may exist on a de facto basis. For example, not all EU member states use the Euro established by its currency union, and not all EU member states are part of the Schengen Area. Some EU members participate in both unions, and some in neither. Territories of the United States, Australian External Territories and New Zealand territories each share a currency and, for the most part, the market of their respective mainland states."
