                "Most historians generally agree that Gilgamesh was a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk , who probably ruled sometime during the early part of the Early Dynastic Period ( c. 2900-2350 BCE ) . It is certain that , during the later Early Dynastic Period , Gilgamesh was worshipped as a god at various locations across Sumer . In the twenty-first century BCE , Utu-hengal , the king of Uruk adopted Gilgamesh as his patron deity . The kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur were especially fond of Gilgamesh , calling him their divine brother and friend . During this period , a large number of myths and legends developed surrounding him . Probably during the Middle Babylonian Period ( c. 1600 BCE - c. 1155 BCE ) , a scribe named S\u00een-l\u0113qi-unninni composed the Epic of Gilgamesh , an epic poem written in Akkadian narrating Gilgamesh 's heroic exploits . The opening of the poem describes Gilgamesh as one-third human , two-thirds divine",
