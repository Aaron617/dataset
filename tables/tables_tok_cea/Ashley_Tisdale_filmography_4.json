She was eventually cast in her first main role in Disney Channel's The Suite Life of Zack & Cody in 2005, which had three seasons (2005-2008). Tisdale's breakthrough role came in the 2006 television movie High School Musical, which became Disney Channel's most-watched movie that year. The High School Musical series became a successful franchise which included the second television movie High School Musical 2 (2007), a feature film High School Musical 3: Senior Year (2008), and a spin-off movie Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure (2011). She has a main role in Phineas & Ferb (2007-2015), which became television's most-watched animated series among kids and tweens and had very positive reviews, and had guest appearances in Kim Possible (2007), Family Guy (2009), The Cleveland Show (2009), Glenn Martin, DDS (2009) and Fish Hooks (2009).
