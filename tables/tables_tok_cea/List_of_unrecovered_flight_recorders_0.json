The manufacturer performed maintenance on the airplane a year before the crash , during which they documented that no recorders were installed ( though mounting racks were in place for the operator to install them if they later decided to ) . Rwandan aviation laws at the time required all airplanes used for transporting the head of state to carry both a CVR and an FDR .
