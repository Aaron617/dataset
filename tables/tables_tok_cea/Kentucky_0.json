    "intro": "Kentucky (UK: /k\u025bn\u02c8t\u028cki/ ken-TUK-ee, US: /k\u0259n-/ (listen) k\u0259n-), officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the Southern United States. Although styled as the State of Kentucky in the law creating it, (because in Kentucky's first constitution, the term state was used), Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky split from it and became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States. Kentucky is known as the Bluegrass State, a nickname based on the bluegrass, a species of grass found in many of its pastures. One of the major regions in Kentucky is the Bluegrass Region in central Kentucky, which houses its two largest cities, Louisville and Lexington. It is a land with diverse environments and abundant resources, including the world's longest cave system, Mammoth Cave National Park, one of the greatest lengths of navigable waterways and streams in the contiguous United States, and the two largest man-made lakes east of the Mississippi River. Kentucky is also known for horse racing, bourbon, moonshine, coal, My Old Kentucky Home historic state park, automobile manufacturing, tobacco, bluegrass music, college basketball, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the Kentucky colonel."
