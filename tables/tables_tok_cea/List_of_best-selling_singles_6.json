The singles listed here were cited by reliable sources from various media, such as digital journalism, newspapers, magazines, and books. It is notable that, according to Guinness World Records, Irving Berlin's White Christmas (1942) as performed by Bing Crosby is the best-selling single worldwide, with estimated sales of over 50 million copies. The song, recognized as the best-selling single of all time, was released before the pop/rock singles-chart era and was listed as the world's best-selling single in the first-ever Guinness Book of Records (published in 1955) and - remarkably - still retains the title more than 50 years later.

In 1997, John performed a rewritten version of the song as a tribute to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, is the biggest-selling single since UK and US singles charts began in the 1950s, having accumulated worldwide sales of 33 million copies, making it the second-best-selling physical single of all time.
