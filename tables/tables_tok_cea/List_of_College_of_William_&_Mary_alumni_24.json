It is a public research university and has more than 94,000 living alumni. Alumni of William & Mary have played important roles in shaping the United States.

Because the school was one of the few colleges existing in the Colonies, many colonial era notables enrolled including four signers of the Declaration of Independence and the first president of the Continental Congress, Peyton Randolph.
