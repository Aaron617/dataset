That means all of the acts who became number one this year got their first Dutch number-one single. Bruno Mars got his first number-one single as a featured artist in Nothin' On You for two weeks, his second again as a featured artist in Billionaire for one week, and his third as his first single as a lead artist in Just the Way You Are for 11 straight weeks. The last time that an act was number-one for 11 weeks was in 2007, when Andr\u00e9 Hazes and Gerard Joling became number-one for 11 weeks with Blijf Bij Mij. The last time an artist had three number-one singles in one year happened in 2006, when Marco Borsato hit the number-one position with Because We Believe featuring Andrea Bocelli, Rood and Everytime I Think of You featuring Lucie Silvas. It is the first time that the Dutch Top 40 only got 10 number-one singles in one year, and the third time (after 1988 and 1990) that there were no Dutch number one-singles. This year, there were two singles that held the number-one position for just one week (Billionaire and Bumpy Ride), which has not happened since 2007."
