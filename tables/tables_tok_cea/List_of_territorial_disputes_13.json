The movement gathered signatures from over 7000 inhabitants of legal age at the \u00c5land Islands in 1917 ( that was about 96% of the population ) - they all supported a union with Sweden . When Finland became independent ( December 6 , 1917 ) Sweden wanted a plebiscite about the future of the \u00c5land Islands to solve the problem . Finland refused and argued that the \u00c5land Islands had always been a natural part of Finland - even when Finland was under Swedish rule . Sweden appealed to the League of Nations referring to the right of the population to determine which country they should belong to . After studying the matter closely the League of Nations decided Finland should retain sovereignty over the province but that the \u00c5land Islands should be made an autonomous territory . The Swedish Prime Minister said he did n't accept the verdict but he also said that Sweden was not going to use military force to get their claims",

Under the Treaty of Tartu , 1920 the above territories were ceded from RSFSR to the newly-established Republic of Estonia that was annexed by the USSR in 1940 as the Estonian SSR . In 1944 with two decrees of the USSR supreme Council the city of Narva and vicinity was split along Narova river leaving Narva with Estonia and Ivangorod with the Leningrad oblast . Pechory , Izborsk and Panikovichi with respective parishes as well as certain areas of Slobodskaya parish were transferred to the Pskov Oblast . Exception was made for some rural areas of the borderland populated by ethnic Estonians leaving these with Estonian SSR . After the fall of the Soviet Union this caused a territorial dispute that was resolved with a Russian-Estonian Border Treaty . Some sources argue Estonia might have claims in the area",

In 1920 , Polish General Lucjan Zeligowski led a coup and established the Republic of Central Lithuania which was annexed to the Second Polish Republic after the war as part of the historic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and due to ethnic Poles in the region . Lithuania moved its capital to Kaunas while never giving up its claim to Vilnius . The Lithuanians found support in the Soviet Union for their cause signing the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty in 1939 . Following the Soviet invasion of Poland , the region came under Soviet control and became part of the Lithuanian SSR after World War II which was followed by a large number of ethnic Poles being deported two times . Following the fall of the Soviet Union and Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania the Vilnius region became part of Lithuania again",
