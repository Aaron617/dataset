    "intro": "This list is for railway lines across Britain, which are now long abandoned, closed, dismantled or disused. Most of these old railway lines have since re-opened, whether preserved as Heritage Railways, or as part of the national network en-route, whilst some have converted to cycle paths, footpaths or lanes. Some of the closed railway lines, are former ex-cross country mainline routes, some were local branch lines, with a few being ex-working colliery lines that once served towns, villages and local settlements, as well as the UK's Industry.
